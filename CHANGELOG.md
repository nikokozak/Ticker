All notable user-facing changes to Ticker are documented here.

## Unreleased

### Added
- Selected stream text can now be linked to a picked PDF spot.
- PDF stream links now reopen their source and navigate back to the saved highlight.
- PDF pane with continuous scrolling and stream links back to selected highlights.
- Quick Panel ephemeral chats can save individual messages and clear the in-memory conversation.
- Quick Panel Save and AI + Save now append directly to stream documents, including live inserts into an open editor.
- Live markdown concealment and image widgets for a calmer document-writing surface.
- Revision-aware stream document saves to protect external appends from stale autosaves.

### Changed
- PDF pane header controls now use compact icon toolbar styling and keep their hit targets with long source names.
- Stream editor, overlays, Quick Panel, and PDF pane now share a lower-chrome tokenized visual system.
- Bridge v2 is the live bidirectional document-model contract, routed through feature handlers with surfaced errors.

### Fixed
- Recovered quick-capture notes that previously didn't appear in streams.
- Restored Quick Panel selected-text context preview and blockquote saves.
- Stopped embedded stream images from flickering or refetching while editing nearby text, and made cursor movement skip image tokens atomically.
- Restored the stream editor selection action menu using CodeMirror selection state.
- Made Quick Panel dismissal consistent, stabilized stream picking, and added visible save feedback.

### Removed
- Removed dead TipTap/cell-era editor paths, legacy bridge messages, cell write/read paths, and unused LLM providers from active runtime.
